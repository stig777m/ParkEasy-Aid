# ParkEasy-Aid
A project which can automate the parking lot facility features.
The project is built in Java

Once you set the set the parameters of the desired parking lot, like the number of parking lots across and lengthwise(assuming the parking lot is in a rectangle shape), the number of parking slots for Eletric Vehicles(these will be near to the power source or likewise) and number of parking slots for special needs vehicles(these will be near to the lift lobby or likewise). And the user can set a Per Hour Charge as needed.

The project will register the specific details and now it is ready to operate as a ticketing machine for the parking lot.

When a Vehicle comes into the entrance of the parking lot, the customer is asked for the vehicle number and its type(Normal, EV, sepcial needs) based on the type the vehicle is alotted a parking space, considering the type and the closest available space so that the occupants of the vechile need not walk as much.
The alloted is calculated using the maps theory.
